# Machine Learning Security Evasion Competition 2021 ([mlsec2021](https://mlsec.io/))
## Anti-Phishing Evasion Track

The dawn of the digital age has unleashed the Captain Ahab's upon the sea's of the cyber world and its great white whale is root on your machine.  While most of the time many play the role of the great white whale attempting to thwart the ever relenting Ahab's of the world from trying to harpoon their way into networks via specially crafted phishing sites, but in this rare case the roles have been reversed.  10 phishing samples are supplied and the goal of each participant ois to devise a method to bypass the 7 ml models trained to detect phioshing sites.  Every method must recreate an exact pixel for pixel representaion of the phishing site within a Chromium based browser running within  the competition's sandbox.  So with these simple rules set let the phishing begin.
